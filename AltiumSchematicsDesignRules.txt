### Structure
#############
1) Provide all supplemental documentation necessary to read your design.
Structure of directory for the project:
	- Documentation - composite diagrams/prove of concept, other global to the project data
	- Project directories - directories where separate board project designs reside
		- Documentation - datasheets mostly
		- RefDesign - eval's schematics
		- project files
	- multiboard files
Remove 'History' directory from your design - look for Altium settings.

2) Use hierarchical design :
multiboard assembly
	board 1
		main sheet
			sub sheet 1
				sub sub sheet 1
				...
			sub sheet 2
			...
	board 2
		...
	board 3
		...
This makes your design consisten and more easily readable and checkable.

Use strict hierarchy in your design - even power port should be local to the list.
It is difficult to find all occurences of some signal smeared over several sheets.

3) Do not create swiss knife components. 
Divide your components at parts accordingly to its purpose.
Common guide for this rule :
	- separate power signals from data signals
	- separate pwr and gnd signals if there is too many pins for this purpose
	- separate data/control signals from setup pins (for example RST and SS from UART and I2C)

4) Do not copy components and parts of the design. 
This is error prone way of design. Man is not a machine, he/she can't duplicate completelly something.
Use repeat blocks.

5) Do not overcomplicate your design - if your board have one led and one resistor - make it one file only.
If your design is a shame make it looks like a shame not like something great.

	3.1) Do not overuse/abuse Altium facilities.
	It means not to use harnesses and nets without necessity. 
	It makes your design harder to read and understand.
	Do not divide component that consists of 3..5 signals.
	Keep everything as simple as possible.

6) One for all resources/entities (for example PU for I2C), 
should be represented at the main sheet - at the head of your design.
Common error for hierarchical designs - PU I2C lines in each list where it used.

7) Do not use compile mask for final design.
If you want to save some components or solutions for further use,
move it to separate list in separate folder.

### Readability
###############
1) Avoid formats bigger than A3. Divide your design.
It is inconvenient to read and print designs that utilizes formats bigger than A3.
Think that A2 is the maximum format that is availible to you 
and use it in case of the extreme necessity.

1.1) Try to decrease formats nomenclature in your design.
If you used A2 allready, try to avoid of using A4, it is inconsistent design solution.
It can be approved only in case of very big projects > 10..15 lists.

2) Divide your desing parts using net labels, do not pull lines across all list.
If you are disigning simple RC filter, make it looks like RC filter, 
not like a complex tangle of signals.
If your design simple, making it difficult to read is the sign of insanity.
Nobody wants to work with insane people.

3) Avoid to have empty space at the list. This is sign of the bad design.
Schematics is a draw. Drawing composition is the engineering basics - learn it.
If you can't compose draw properly, don't do this work at all.

###############
### Electronics
###############
5) Avoid to use LDO in your design. 
It is more than enough modern all in one pulse power supply modules at the market.
This mean that usage of LDO should be approved by some strong causes.

6) Do not use cristals in your designs. Prefer to use generators.
Too long to explain - just follow this rule.

7) Avoid to create new components in your design. Do not inflate nomenclature.
Try to utilize what already utilized in company. Look TOM's library.

8) If you want to have some signs in silk - write it in your design directly.
